                            <p> When I installed steam from Slackbuilds I got: cannot find dpkg So I sboinstalled dpkg and now it's saying "apt-get" not found. uhhhh Is there a way to do this without morphing my system into Ubuntu. If anyone else is experiencing terrible graphical performance and/or artifacts like flashing, tearing, flickering, etc. after upgrading to `nvidia 390.25`, your best bet right now seems to be to downgrade to a version of `nvidia 387.34` patched to support `linux 4.15`. There are some good instructions in this thread (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1766195), specifically this post (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1766195#p1766195). These are the full steps Claymore doesnt correspond to GPU #'s that's showing in OverDriveNtool. Since I have all RX570's, I want to fine tune them to eliminate errors. Also, is there a way to tell which GPU is which in ODNT as they all show Radeon RX 570 series? I have 3 diff kinds of gpus in 4 gpu build. Well i was trying to use a emulator for xbox (Xenia) that uses Vulkan and it says that my pc doesn't have support to it. So i looked to the vulkaninfo.exe console and it says this: =========== VULKAN INFO =========== Vulkan API Version: 1.0.61 INFO: loader Code 0 : loaderGetRegistryFiles: opening device PCI\VEN_10DEampDEV_1212ampSUBSYS_C0D0144DampREV_A1amp18249c67amp0amp0008 INFO: loader Code 0 : loaderGetDeviceRegistryEntry: Device ID(1) Does not contain a value for "Vulka.

I can't get the game to use the custom resolution in my driver settings. I want to play at 4:3 stretched 1024x768@75hz on a 1440x900@60hz native resolution display. The custom resolution is 1024x768@75hz, but the one in game seems to only be at 60hz. I can confi. I have a GTX 750ti and I'm not being able to correctly install its drivers, every time I try to install it from the command line, when I reboot, it gets stuck before the login screen, making me to remove the drivers, I tried different versions, but still without success. I would use nouveau drivers, but it is very glitchy. I'm using Elementary OS. EDIT: IT WORKED! I just installed an older version of the driver, maybe the ones I was trying to install weren't compatible or something. I have a working VFIO setup, and I am not looking to wreck it at this time. But I am quite intrigued by Qubes. Has anyone here tried it, and how does it compare with a VFIO GPU setup, performance-wise. 
I'm looking to build a desktop with my main goal being to have 3 1080p monitors side by side in portrait mode. These monitors have DVI/HDMI/VGA inputs. Does anybody have any suggestions for which graphics card(s) I should get to achieve this? Along with the graphic card(s), will I need a specific motherboard? If possible, I'd like to add a 4th monitor in the future. I don't game so I won't need anything more powerful than the ability to edit photos while watching videos. I just ordered my Lenovo Y510P from amazon (0, sli 750m, i7-4700mq, Windows 8), and I have been reading about a ton of problems when updating to Windows 8.1, such as the SLI, mouse issues, network connectivity, etc. I have a few questions. 1. Is I'm using ClassicShell, is it even worth it to update to Windows 8.1? Besides for more customization, is their any better performance? 2. So I'm wondering, should I wait a bit to update to Windows 8.1? 3. Also, if I just update all of my drivers. Linux arch noob here. I've had little success trying to set the graphics card drivers to vfio\_pci and was wondering if anyone could potentially help me.

Hello, I have recently purchased a new super PC. I have both Manjaro and Ubuntu. Observe that I am not a gamer. 1. https://forum.manjaro.org/t/amd-ryzen-problems-and-fixes/55533 2. https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6ox31y/what_is_the_state_of_ryzen_on_linux/ 3. https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/99ge0t/ryzen_5_2400g_linux_compatibility/ 4. https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6crru5/linux_instability_on_ryzen_7/ 5. https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/9y4bnw/are_there_any_p. Title. I have updated my laptops integrated graphics card drivers and nvidia graphics card. I believe the laptop is a legion y530, but maybe a legion y520. It has a geforce gtx 1050 ti, I have the hdmi cable to vga adapater plugged into the monitor and the monitor is powered on but windows can't detect the monitor as much as I tried. Any suggestions would be great. I have bought a MSI GS65 Stealth Thin 8RF with a 1070 maxq gtx last year, i never update my vga driver (actually i have this version 398.35). I search on msi website and i found that the last vga version for my laptop are the 398.35. But on the nvdia site the last version is the 430.39, i know that maxq driver are tweaked so i should not install those driver from the nvidia site it's right? Also i look on the msi site and i found that the laptop msi gs65 stealth 8SE/SF/SG with the geforce. Cleaning out some hardware, feel free to contact me by PM to talk about any item. I can provide more images. Please post PM before contacting me. amp#x200B; # COMPLETE SYSTEM - HP Pavilion Elite e9290f Desktop PC w/mATX Mobo System in nice shape, just replaced with new.

Hello guys, I already had my setup running for around 2 Months. No problems once it was running. This weekend I got my 10gbit network card, which I also want to pass through. The problem, the graphic card i am passing through to the vm is alot bigger than the card from the host system. And its blocking my third PCI Slot. So for the Network Card to fit, I needed to swap the graphic cards. Now my passing through card is in the primary slot, the host card in the secondary slot. After For the past few months since I've came back from being retired I'm dealing with some weird display issues. Don't really have an idea how to show it as it only occurs on my monitor tho. Anyway, when I'm walking I can see that sprites, nicknames, character models etc. start to blur or stutter, idk how to name it. Everything is so blurry, especially nicknames (even during NPC movement while I stand still, blurry af). I'd say it is most visible with stuff that has black edges. Tried almost. I stumbled upon this post by u/flappers87, so all credit to them, but even being two years old it fixed the problem of my PC under performing, so maybe it will work for you! amp#x200B; gtHey all gt gtSo this is targeting people who like me, have a 144hz primary monitor and a 60hz secondary monitor. gt gt The Problem gt gtThere is a bug with Nividia and Windows 10. By using the default refresh rates off of the same GPU, you will find that your idle clock speeds. 
I have a few years old TV, it's a flat screen, and big, and I've connected it to my computer from the TV's DVI to my computer's VGA. The VGA is for the NVIDIA GTX 970. I've also tried removing the DVI to VGA adapter and connected the TV to my motherboard instead. Neither works. The TV input is set to PC, but I've cycled through the inputs to be sure. Can anyone please guide me in troubleshooting this, find out what's wrong and how to solve it? I always keep my Geforce drivers up to date. Dear reddit Community, amp#x200B; Been having some issues with playing Farcry New Dawn, have gone through the ubisoft support team and they haven't been able to solve the issue. I can't find anything similar online about this so I figured I would reach out to you all. amp#x200B; When I play the game it automatically plays off of the Integrated Intel GPU instead of the GTX 1060 which causes huge issues with the graphics quality making it unplayable. amp#x200B; Things I have tried. Hello, I've tried to update an hackintosh on El Capitan to High Sierra but I can't make Nvidia driver working. I've tried a lot of thing, install Nvidia WebDriver (good version, I had no need to patch installer and I think it should work because it choose Nvidia Web Driver by default in Nvidia Driver Manager), change SMBIOS (I used iMAC 14,2), I look for this but don't really understand how it work: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/fix-10-12-10-13-nvidia-2-3-4-5-6-7-9-10xx-series-black-scre. Hi , i thought there is a need for a guide on that topic. So i will try my best to explain how to properly use dedicated gpu's for avoiding performance issues. I'm not a native speaker , so bare with my somewhat broken English. Guide will be centric to Ubuntu 18.04 base ( since i'm on Mint 19.1 ) , especially for Nvidia Prime. Nvidia Optimus: First things first ; if you want to do proper gaming with Optimus laptops ; avoid Bumblebee. Web is entirely filled with Bumblebee related topics Hey guys, I'm trying to forward my RTX2060 into a LXC container to aid in transcoding media. I'm however stuck on getting this to work, any help would be much appreciated! amp#x200B; I currently have a RTX2060 installed in my server running Proxmox (4.15.18-11-pve). My container is running Ubuntu 16.04 amp#x200B; My output for `ls -l /dev/dri` is: amp#x200B; total 0 crw-rw---- 1 root video 226, 0 Mar 17 14:10 card0 crw-rw---- 1 root video 226, 1 Mar 18 07:27 card1. 
I'm using Linux Mint, but I assume it's fine to ask for a bit of help here too.? amp#x200B; I've decided to move from Windows to Linux Mint 19.1 (based on Ubuntu 18.04), installation went just fine. The only problem I'm facing is with my ethernet connection - PC recognizes that it has ethernet, but won't connect to a network, it would just try to connect infinitely. The device in question is Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet. By default it was using the r8169 driver </p>
