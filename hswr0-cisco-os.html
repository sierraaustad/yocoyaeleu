Cisco Networking Software (IOS, XE, XR, and NX-OS) integrates technology innovation, business-critical services, and hardware platform support. Компания начинает свою историю с 1975 года, когда друзья-студенты Гарварда Билл Гейтс и Пол Аллен, прочитав опубликованную 1 января 1975 года в журнале «Popular Electronics (англ. Inc. Cisco Systems.

Bruce Alexander. Cisco IOS Networking Software delivers a seamless integration of technology innovation, business-critical services, and hardware platform support. John Alexander. Cisco IOS (от англ. Internetwork Operating System — Межсетевая Операционная Система) — программное обеспечение, используемое в маршрутизаторах и сетевых коммутаторах Cisco. Vivek Alwayn. Cisco IOS, formally the Internetwork Operating System, is a family of network operating systems used on many Cisco Systems routers and current Cisco network switches. 
I am a newbie to the cisco world and looking to start studying for the ccna. I was able to get my hands on 2 Cisco Catalyst 2950 switches, from 2002. Is it worth my time to learn the commands for these switches or has the Cisco OS changed drastically since then? Thank. Vijay Anand.

The Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.4 T has been retired and is no longer supported. Is it possible to back up ios's from flash to an tftp server (tftpd) in a live environment, devices like routers and switches for example on Nexus, 4510s Danelle. Сетевое программное обеспечение Cisco (IOS, XE, XR и NX-OS), занимающее ведущие позиции на мировом рынке программного обеспечения сетевой инфраструктуры, характеризуется. I work for a good-sized Cisco shop and have been otherwise working with Cisco products for many years but for a little over a year now it seems that at nearly every upgrade/expansion/installation we're thwarted by some sort of catastrophic software bug. I've encountered plenty of Cisco software defects in the past and would normally be able to point to development/QA issues with a single platform but our issues have spanned everything from firewalls, routers, switches, and wireless. A number. David Barnes. 
Open Cisco NX-OS Software is the industry's most extensible, open, and programmable network operating system. It enables network automation and allows customers to programmatically provision and configure switches through comprehensive APIs, utilizing tools provided by Cisco and open-source. Not trying to spend too much money on it, really. I've been studying CCNA for the past 6 months and will attempt to hopefully take the exam by end of year if I feel prepared enough. I have no experience whatsoever when it comes to working in the field hence why i'm looking for some equipment so I can practice on with. Thanks in advanced. Greg Bastien. 
The Cisco Security portal provides actionable intelligence for security threats and vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services and third-party products. So I've been working with Cisco equipment for about three years and I am just now apparently finding out that there are two types of Cisco OS's. I knew there was such a thing as a supervisor engine with the expansion cards although I've never worked with them and I'm sure I'm not even using the correct terms to describe them. I just figured they were all just different flavors of IOS. I just ordered a Cisco Catalyst 2948G-GE-TX and I was all ready to start making configurations on it until. Good Morning, everyone - Hoping to get some insight on some weird behavior I'm seeing on a couple of virtual Nexus 9K switches I am configuring in VIRL. I have configured the vPC domain (and associated interfaces) with the same config I use on my production N9K's. The only difference is my production switches are on NXOS 7 and these virtual switches are on NXOS 9. Unfortunetly, I can't seem to get the KeepAlive link to come online. It is showing suspended, and both switches show peer unreach. Baumrucker. Cisco DevNet: APIs, SDKs, Sandbox, and Community for Cisco Developers. I was thinking, with all the DIY projects out there, i am surprised there are not parts out there you can buy to make your own switch or router. I mean i would imagine all you would need at minimum is 2 things. An interface board with say.5 LAN ports on it and an OS like Cisco's OS for their switches. God how i wish i was an engineer and/or programmer. Michael H. Behringer. 
I'm in a position where I suspect the majority of people here have been; I bought something awesome because I thought it was too cheap to pass up. I purchased a Cisco Nexus 93120TX for about the same price I can get a decently loaded R620. I am in a window where I can swap the Cisco for the R620 and have maybe another week and a half to decide if I want to do that. The 93120TX is a 96 port 10GB Ethernet level 3 switch with a permanent license from Cisco (no annual fees from what I understand. Vijay Bollapragada. Operating systems. In most cases, the technology for the Catalyst Switch was developed separately from Cisco's router technology. The Catalyst switches originally ran software called CatOS rather than the more widely known Cisco IOS software used by routers. Is anyone running Cisco Nexus 3048 in an small to medium business environment, or are we the only ones? amp#x200B; We've got two Cisco Nexus 3048 multi-layer core switches. I found out some people are kind of shocked about that. Basically they're like, why would you buy those for a small to medium business environment? I didn't know why the IT Director chose those, but I wanted to find out in case the question comes up again. Apparently at the time it was one of the few multi-layer. NX-OS is a network operating system for the Nexus-series Ethernet switches and MDS-series Fibre Channel storage area network switches made by Cisco Systems.

It doesn't need to be stackable. The only candidate I'm finding so far is the C3850-12XS-S. Anything else comparable in price/size. Kevin Dooley. Hello all! A local offer has popped up for me that i would be interesting in taking but want to make sure im not going to get my self into a situation of me wasting (more) money on something that I buy blind and end up unable to work with it. Basically im looking if someone could tell me some info about the Cisco UCS server systems. they look like standard servers but I've been burned with cisco stuff lately and don't want to have that happen again.

Syngress. I came across this on an audio site. It is the Clones Audio folks modifying a Cisco network switch (https://www.clonesaudio.com/networking). Eh? As someone who spent years working on IOS (the Cisco OS, not iPhones) and pushing the gear to its limits, this is just out there. The code running the switch ensures through TCP/IP that nothing is dropped or malformed. I would take test gear and saturate the backplanes. Here, audio will never get a port anywhere near 1 gigabit/sec. The ports. Anthony Bruno. Hi all, amp#x200B; I have been looking with very little results comparing two different NX-OS versions for a Nexus 9500 chassis switch. amp#x200B; I am comparing 7.0(3)I4(8b) to 7.0(3)I5(2) amp#x200B; Currently have 7.0(3)I5(1) installed, but due to a bug was asked to install 7.0.(3)I5(2) which is not a starred version, but is an ISSU update to the previous release. amp#x200B; 7.0.(3)I4(8b) now supports the line card I have that was initially not supported. So is also a valid. Welcome to Cisco Feature Navigator Cisco Feature Navigator allows you to quickly find the right Cisco IOS, IOS XE, IOS XR,NX-OS and CatOS software release for the features you want to run on your network. 
So I'm trying to figure out a weird issue with Cisco ISE. I've mentioned this in a previous post, but I wanted to follow up with /r/networking on this. Going through the logs our team came accross this line: EAPoLController server died EAPoLController died This is the first time I've seen this issue on the clients machines. And I'm now realizing that, when debugging 802.1x on the cisco switch, I'm not seeing any any EAPoL sessions inititated on the switch or in ISE.

I'm new to Nexus. Web searches related to NX-OS reveal mountains of white papers and marketing pizzazz, but I'm struggling to understand (in practical terms) what benefits NX-OS would provide outside of a data center environment, given that it seems to be quite similar to IOS. Is it simply a matter of SDN compatibility and bandwidth capacity? I hope I didn't make your eyes roll. I'm an IOS guy interviewing for a job that includes a bit of NX-OS, and I would like to have a basic understanding. James Henry Carmouche.
